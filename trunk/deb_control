Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libgnome-keyring0, libpurple0
Description: integrates pidgin (and libpurple) with the GNOME keyring
 Pidgin usually stores passwords as plaintext with the "save password" function. This plugin instead saves all passwords to the gnome keyring, which some would argue is a more secure form of password storage.
